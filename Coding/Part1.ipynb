    "# The Quant Testing Framework I use to create profitable strategies\n",
    "Here is my setup for creating profitable strategies in quant. The framework is quite large and still expanding, meaning that I will post each of its aspects individually, and explain how they all fit together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modules I have created are:\n",
    "- yggdrasil.py: contains the class Yggdrasil, which is the root of all my code; it creates an\n",
    " instance of a strategy which acts on a set of stocks. Combines StockAnalyzer and\n",
    " StrategyHelper (see below).\n",
    "- market_analy: contains a detailed retrieval method which obtains either live data or\n",
    " previously stored personal data given a set of parameters including trading frequency\n",
    " and number of data points\n",
    "-  useful_methods: this is a module of helper functions which helps display code and various\n",
    " results easier and helps in analysis\n",
    "-  strategy_analy: contains the class StockAnalyzer which can run various types of analysis,\n",
    " given a set of stocks  \n",
    "- strategy_helper.py: contains the class StrategyHelper which creates an instance of a\n",
    " working strategy depending on which strategy is picked; does not contain a stock list\n",
    " but merely the strategy logic\n",
    "-  test_live_helper.py: runs the actual live trading bot based on the tested strategy logic of\n",
    " the other modules.\n",

    "        - strat_list: List of available executable strategies; mostly for convenience.\n",
    "        - analysis: Various aspects of the stock list and the method being used; mostly for convenience\n",

    "              - custom: the type ofdata being used, if custom or live\n",
    "              - shift: how much the data isbeing shifted in its extraction. Measured in days regardless of the units of freq. Default value of 0.\n",
    "              - num_points: number of data points in the extracted data. Note that this does not always return the exact number passed,but has a minimal error range in most cases ( Â±10). Default value is 500.\n",
    "              - stock_list: the list of stocks the strategy as defined by theprevious parameters will act on\n",
    "       - Instance methods:\n",
    "            - __ set_title(self): Private method called upon instantiation which sets the title of the strategy if needed<br>\n",

    "      - The set of parameters is defined first and then the strategy is tested upon a list of variousstocks. In the given example, the set of parameters is the shift of the data and the parameters of the strategy being used, which is Mean Reversion in this case defined by two metrics.\n",
    "        - These are the size of the rolling data used to compute metrics like the mean, and the cutoff z-score used to enter/exit the strategy. Everything else is held constant. \n",
    "      - Note that in this example, I'm currently in the process of creating viable classes for stock classification, meaning that each allocation of stocks being tested asthe last parameter is merely just each individual stock only. The classification inthe example given is simply that the number of completed trades is above 30 in the given data set and the profit is positive.\n",
