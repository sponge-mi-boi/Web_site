        <h1>QG SPINOR</h1>
        <p>Hey! I'm Varun, an aspiring physics researcher and learning quant trader who's interested in a variety of topics at the intersection of theoretical physics, mathematics, and computer science. This is a repository for all my explorations and research, including theoretical physics study, related mathematics, and computation. In general, anything which I think is cool and should be documented.
            <br><br>(Note: I've attempted to rank all the content in terms of difficulty.)
