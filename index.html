        <h1>Quantum Gravity and Other Stuff</h1>
        <p>Hey! I'm Varun, an aspiring physics grad student that's interested in a bunch of different things. This is a repository for all my explorations and research, including theoretical physics study, related mathematics, and computation. In general, anything which I think is cool and should be documented.
            <br><br>(Note: I'm not sure exactly, but I've ranked all the content in terms of difficulty.)
