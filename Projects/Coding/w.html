    <h4>This is a documentation and description of my Python-based signal generation and analysis framework to create alpha-generating (α Gen) strategies based on time-series data of various stocks in the SP 500.</h4>

            This provides an overview of the approach, including list of methods that will be experimented, the tools that will be used, and the approaches which will be looked at. <br>

            <p>            The initial focus is on OOP design for efficiency,
                but different classes of strategies and methods of portfolio allocation will be tested and analyzed later.</p>

            </div>

            Conclusion: Using OOP is horrible for strategy testing since it seems it is difficult to define an instance of a
            strategy with a method that is scalable, and it does not seem natural to give such a description.

                The operations are fully vectorized with the use of Dataframes instead of series with lists. The result is a working
                model of backtesting which was done on various pairs, or all found pairs through the ADF test,
                of cointegrated stocks in the SP 500. Parallel processing is also used to speed up operations, which was accurately
                implemented, and parquet files are used for storage. Walk forward testing is used based upon a series of 5 tests and
                stocks which satisfy various attributes are categorized. Also, graphs are given of greatly performing pairs in the
                example time period. Parameter optimization will be done next, along with validation testing.
