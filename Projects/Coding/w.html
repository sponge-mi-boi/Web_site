    <h1 >Alpha-Generation Backtesting Framework</h1>
    <h4>This is a documentation and description of my Python-based signal generation and analysis framework to create alpha-generating (α Gen) strategies based on time-series data of various stocks in the SP 500.</h4>
    This provides an overview of the approach, including list of methods that will be experimented, the tools that will be used, and the approaches which will be looked at. <br>

    The initial focus is on OOP design for efficiency,
    but different classes of strategies and methods of portfolio allocation will be tested and analyzed later.

    Conclusion: Using OOP is horrible for strategy testing since it seems it is difficult to define an instance of a
    strategy with a method that is scalable, and it does not seem natural to give such a description.

    <div style="font-size: medium"><br>Version 0.2 </div>
    A module of various methods is used and the focus is on execution, not architecture.
