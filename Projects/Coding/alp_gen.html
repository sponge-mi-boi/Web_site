            <p>            The initial focus is on OOP design for efficiency,
                but different classes of strategies and methods of portfolio allocation will be tested and analyzed in the future.</p>

                <a href="Version_0_1_Part2.html"> Basic α Gen. Framework: Part 2 (|)</a>


            Conclusion: Using OOP is horrible for strategy testing since it seems it is difficult to define an instance of a
            strategy with a method that is scalable, and it does not seem natural to give such a description.

                    A module of various methods is used and the focus is on execution, not architecture.

                The operations are fully vectorized with the use of Dataframes instead of series with lists. The result is a working
                model of backtesting which was done on various pairs, or all found pairs through the ADF test,
                of cointegrated stocks in the SP 500. Parallel processing is also used to speed up operations, which was accurately
                implemented, and parquet files are used for storage. Walk forward testing is used based upon a series of 5 tests and there is also
                classification of various stocks. Also, graphs are given of the highest performing pairs in the
                example time period. Parameter optimization will be done next, along with validation testing.

                Conclusion: It seems the idea is right, but some of the results are not as accurate, because I actually implemented
                the beta-based, portfolio weights, incorrectly. The full, correctly implemented, list of methods, along with optimization
                parameters, will be next.

            Cointegration is done on hourly data, and there are fixes made as compared to the previous version. In particular, the beta
            based wights for the entry/exit is corrected, and the best stock pairs are shown. Also, the mathematical framework is given
            for the whole framework.

        Cointegration is done on daily data, with the goal being to conduct a rolling forward, validating backtest which is replicable. Future goals are to do this over several periods to find patterns related to cointegrated assets and to find optimal parameters to a greater degree of accuracy.
