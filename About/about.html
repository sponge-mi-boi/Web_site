    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <ul><li>
        Python: Created a backtesting framework. Current project on the most profitable alpha generation strategies for time Series data.
        <ul><br><li><h4 style="margin-top: -20px" >Pandas</h4>: Extensive use of Dataframes and Time Series structures. Used for data collection, analysis, and storage.</li>
            <li> <h4>Numpy</h4> : Use of Numpy along with packages such as Numba to maximize both performance time and storage for backtesting massive amounts of data.</li>
            <li><h4>VectorBt</h4>: Use in most effectively simulating portfolios in backtesting.</li>
            <li><h4>Optuna</h4>: Use in optimizing parameters for strategies. Primarily Bayesian optimization was used.</li>
            <li><h4>joblib</h4>: Use in the implementation of parallel processing to massively speed up my backtesting framework.</li>
            <li><h4>Plotly</h4>: Use in effectively visualizing and analyzing the implementation of various strategies.
    </li></ul>
        <br>
        <li>
        <h4>Java</h4>: Years of experience in terms of study and the implementation of object oriented frameworks in various contexts, including my first prototype of the backtesting framework of my current project.
        </li>
        <br>
    <li>
        <h4>Mathematica</h4>: Created programs to analyze physical systems and solve various differential equations of various levels of complexity
    </li>
    </ul>
        <h2>Past Research</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>QFT in the Early Universe</h4>: A focus on the cosmological foundations of the universe and the emergence of <br>classical systems from quantum fluctuations. Attempted to theoretically model this process, with a focus on the mechanics of entanglement and coherent systems.
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>
            <h4>General Relativity Theoretical Study</h4>: A deep look at various topics in General Relativity, predominantly <br>the formulation of alternate descriptions and extensions of GR with torsion. Also, a focus on the mathematical foundations of the singularity theorems and their implications.
