        <h2>Past Research</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
            QFT in the Early Universe: A focus on the cosmological foundations of the universe and the emergence of <br>classical systems from quantum fluctuations. Attempted to theoretically model this process, with a focus on the mechanics of entanglement and coherent systems.
        </li>
            <br>
        <li>
            General Relativity Theoretical Study: A deep look at various topics in General Relativity, predominantly <br>the formulation of alternate descriptions and extensions of GR with torsion. Also, a focus on the mathematical foundations of the singularity theorems and their implications.
