<h2 id="Quick-Note">Quick Note</h2><p>The general theory of relativity is just an extension of the special theory of
relativity. Instead of stating that merely inertial frames which are frames that
move with constant velocity or do not move at all with respect to each other,
are the ones where the laws of physics are equivalent for observers, it was now
stated that all frames of reference, whether inertial or non-inertial, have the same form of the laws of physics. This was a huge revolutionary step and emphasized the general covariance of truly fundamental theories of
physics.</p>
<h1 id="The-Equivalence-Principle">The Equivalence Principle</h1><p>The most important postulate in GR is that of the equivalence principle. The statement that all frames have equivalent laws of physics, regardless of if they are inertial or not, means that at any point in spacetime, no matter the form of the metric, one can always find a coordinate system that is locally identical to Lorentzian spacetime. This is a coordinate system where the metric takes the form of the Lornentzian spacetime metric, meaning $g = \eta$. This simple principle implies that the conclusions which are drawn on Minkowski space can be applied locally to any spacetime in GR. Locally here means that exactly up to a first derivative term in the sense that for a general metric $g = 1 + \partial_\alpha g dx^\alpha + ...$ with a Taylor series expansion at some point with coordinates $x^\alpha$ at that point, $g = \eta + ...$, the metric behaves exactly like the Lornentzian spacetime metric. Therefore, an observer cannot tell the difference between a general spacetime and flat spacetime up to first order at any point in the general spacetime. Then, it is possible to change coordinates at any given point locally, meaning that Lorentz transformations do still apply, but they are infinitesimal now $x^{i'} = L(\phi)x^i = \frac{\partial x^{i'}}{\partial x^i}dx^i$, meaning $L(\phi) \approx I + (\phi)\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}$ up to first order. This implies that one can only tell if the spacetime is flat or curved by looking at second order terms in the metric, which is exactly how the Riemann tensor is defined.</p>
<p>This is extremely important because the equivalence principle indicates that results which are covariant, meaning written in terms of coordinates, in Lorentzian spacetime can then generalize to arbitrary spacetime by means of a coordinate transformation. Therefore, many of the results in SR can just naturally be extended to GR. This is a principle which will be used many times to simplify calculations.</p>
<p>This leads to the question of transformation laws for tensors, vectors, and other such operators or objects. These were already defined earlier based almost purely from an algebraic perspective as multilinear functions created from vectors and their duals. Since vectors exist independently of any coordinate system, as can be intuitively seen and mathematically proven, their duals and tensors naturally can also be seen to be defined independently of any coordinate system. Of course, only their components transform when the coordinate system is transformed. And since tensors are constructed linearly from vectors, each component of the tensor transforms individually as a vector would. For example, as was already seen, the metric transforms under a coordinate transformation $x^u \rightarrow x^{u'} = L^{u'}_u x^u$, as $g_{uv} \rightarrow g_{u'v'} = L_{u'}^uL_{v'}^v g_{uv}$. Therefore, as was already seen, tensors transform under coordinate transformations in the same way that each of their indices transform. Note that there is an alternate common view taken to define tensors as objects who transform under a certain way. This may have applications in other contexts, such as when one is attempting to describe theories in a purely geometric sense, but the viewpoint I explain is much more intuitive and natural to me. </p>
