<h1 id="Background-Review-SR">Background Review SR</h2><p>The General Theory of Relativity, GR, is a fascinating subject which touches upon and has contributed to various aspects of modern theoretical physics. However, it is unique in the sense that it is distinctly disconnected from all other areas in modern physics because of its decidedly non quantum nature. Since its description is built on the concept of continuity at its core, there is no at least manifestly discrete aspect to this theory. This is why GR is treated differently from all other fundamental branches of modern theoretical physics and the question of quantum gravity, the formulation of a theory which combines GR and quantum field theory, is the biggest open question currently in all of theoretical physics.</p>
<h2 id="Quick-Review-of-Special-Relativity:-Postulates">Quick Review of Special Relativity: Postulates</h2><p>This will be an extremely fast review of the core ideas in special relativity.</p>
<p>There are two main postulates in the formation of this theory as it is usually described.
The first is that all inertial frames have the same laws of physics.</p>
<p>The second is that the speed of light is constant for all observers.</p>
<p>In full accuracy for theory formulation and to keep the minimum number of postulates, it’s easy to show the second actually follows from the first.</p>
<p>Consider Maxwell’s equations, taken in a vacuum. Let $E, B$ be the electric and magnetic fields respectively.$\nabla$⋅ $E$  = 0 , $\mu_0 \, \epsilon_0 \, \frac{\partial \textbf{E}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \textbf{B}$ ,$\nabla$ ⋅ $B$  = 0 , $\frac{\partial \textbf{B}}{\partial t} = - \nabla \times \textbf{E}$</p>
<p>These equations must hold in all reference frames if the first postulate is to hold. But then, the solution to these equations is, using the vector calculus identity$\nabla \times$ ($\nabla$×A) = $\nabla$($\nabla$⋅A) − $\nabla^2$A, where A is any 3 dimensional vector.</p>
<p>$ \nabla \times \textbf{B} = \mu_0 \, \epsilon_0 \, \frac{\partial \textbf{E}}{\partial t} \Rightarrow \nabla \times (\nabla \times \textbf{B}) = \nabla(\nabla \cdot B) - \nabla ^ 2 B = - \nabla ^ 2 B $
$ = \nabla \cdot \mu_0 \, \epsilon_0 \, \frac{\partial \textbf{E}}{\partial t}  \frac{\partial \textbf{B}}{\partial t} = - \nabla \times \textbf{E} \Rightarrow -\nabla ^ 2 B = - \mu_0 \, \epsilon_0 \,\frac{\partial ^ 2 \textbf{B}}{\partial t} \Rightarrow \nabla ^ 2 B = \mu_0 \, \epsilon_0 \,\frac{\partial ^ 2 \textbf{B}}{\partial t} $</p>
<p>This is the wave equation in 3D space, where for any scalar field A(x) describing a ’particle’ moving as a wave with velocity of magnitude v
$ \Rightarrow \nabla ^ 2 A = \frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial ^ 2 \textbf{A}}{\partial t} $ with $ v = \frac{1}{(\mu_0 \, \epsilon_0)^{1/2}} = c $</p>
<p>Note however, that if Maxwell’s equations were to be true in any reference frame as the first postulate states, they must always move at speed c, no matter the reference frame an observer is in, since c is equal to merely a constant. Then, this implies that the speed of light is always c in any reference frame, showing that the second postulate follows almost directly from the first.</p>
<h2 id="The-Invariant-Metric">The Invariant Metric</h2><p>Note from before, taking for example the x component of the magnetic field $B_x(x)$ $(\nabla ^2 - \frac{\partial ^ 2 }{c^2 \partial ^ 2 t}) B_x( x ) = 0$ must have the same form in all inertial frames. Consider a coordinate transformation $x' = T x$. Then, $(\nabla' ^2 - \frac{\partial ^ 2 }{c^2 \partial ^ 2 t'}) {B'}_{x'}( x’ ) = 0 $. $B_x(x)$ transforms as $B'_{x'}{x'} = T B_{x}(T^{-1}x)$, since $B_x$ is the components of a vector. Therefore, $B_x$ is invariant, meaning that for the equation to be true in both reference frames for any such transformation, $\nabla ^2 - \frac{\partial ^ 2 }{v^2 \partial ^ 2 t} =  \nabla' ^2 - \frac{\partial ^ 2 }{c^2 \partial ^ 2 t'} $. Defining,
$-\partial ^2 =\nabla ^2 - \frac{\partial ^ 2 }{c^2 \partial ^ 2 t} \Rightarrow \partial ^2 = (\partial') ^2$
Now, as is common in relativity, define $x^1 = x, x^2 = y, x^3 = z$ and let $x^i$ indicate these spatial indices. Then, $\partial^2 = {\partial^2} _ {ct} - {\partial^2}_i$. From the 1-1 relationship between vectors $\partial_u$ and their duals $dx^u$ with a metric $g_{uv}$, the vector $\partial$ having its magnitude conserved means that $\partial^2 = g^{uv} \partial_u \partial_v = dx^u \partial_u = g_{uv} dx^u dx^v$ is actually being conserved with in this case $g_{00} = 1, g_{ii} = -1$, 0 otherwise. This is the Minkowski metric, defined as $g_{uv} = \eta_{uv}$. Here, $x_0 = ct$, and therefore the interval defined by the metric $\eta_{uv}$ is invariant  $(dx)^2 = (c dt)^2 - (dx^i)^2$.</p>
<h2 id="Lorentz-Transformations">Lorentz Transformations</h2><p>Consider an object at rest in a coordinate frame O’ and moving at velocity $v$ in frame O in the $x^1$ direction. How are the coordinates in O related to those in O'?</p>
<p>$T(x) = x' \Rightarrow d x'^2 = d x^2$ where T is the transformation from the coordinates in O to those in O'. Taking T to be linear,
$  x = \begin{bmatrix} ct \\ x^1 \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow x' = \begin{bmatrix} ct' \\ x'^1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\ f &amp; g \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} ct \\ x^1 \end{bmatrix}$ where the matrix T is explicitly defined. $x' = \begin{bmatrix}a(ct) + bx^1 \\ f(ct) + g  x^1 \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow (dx)^2 = (c dt)^2 - (dx^1)^2 $
$\Rightarrow ((a^2)(ct)^2 + (b^2)(x^1)^2  + 2ab(ct)x^1 - ((f^2)(ct)^2 + (g^2)(x^1)^2 + 2fg(ct)(x^1)) $
$= (a^2 - f^2)(ct)^2 + (b^2-g^2)(x^1)^2 + 2ctx^1(ab - fg) = (ct)^2 - (x^1)^2 $ since the metric must be invariant under change of coordinates. Then,
$ a^2 - f^2 = 1, b^2-g^2 = -1, ab - fg = 0$.</p>
<p>There are 3 equations with 4 unknowns.
Consider solutions of the form $a=\cosh\phi,b=\sinh\phi,f=\sinh\phi,g=\cosh\phi$. This is not an unreasonable guess due to the identity $\cosh^2\phi - \sinh^2\phi = 1$. However, there is an uncertainty in the signs. The first two equations can accept either $\pm \cosh\phi, \pm \sinh\phi$. There are 16 total possibilities, but however, the third equation reduces the possibilities by half. To reduce it further, consider the edge case where the object is in the rest frame of $O'$. This ensures that $x^{1'} = 0$, which ensures the condition $fct + gx^1 = 0$. Physically, ct must be positive, which means that $f,g$ must have opposite signs. This reduces the possibilities to 4. Consider the other equation $ct' = a(ct) + b(x^1)$. If $v$ between the two frames was negative, $x^1$ would be a negative value. To offset that, $b$ would have to be negative in that case as well and $a$ cannot be negative since $t',t$ both cannot be negative. Therefore, $a$ is taken to be positive, $b$ is negative.</p>
<p>Consider further the quantity $\frac{x^1}{t}$ which is just the velocity of the moving frame $O'$ as seen by $O$. Therefore, since $O'$ is moving away from $O$ in the positive $x^1$ direction, v is positive, meaning that $v = \frac{-fc}{g}$. Taking the magnitude, $|v| = \frac{\sinh \phi}{\cosh \phi}c  = \tanh\phi \, c$. Then, note that the identity $\tanh^2(\phi) = 1 -\sec^2\phi$
$\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\cosh ^2 \phi} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{\cosh ^2 \phi} = 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \Rightarrow \cosh ^2 \phi = \frac{1}{ 1- \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \Rightarrow \cosh \phi = (\frac{1}{ 1- \frac{v^2}{c^2}})^{1/2}$.This quantity is defined as the Lorentz factor $(\frac{1}{ 1- \frac{v^2}{c^2}})^{1/2} =\gamma $. Then, $ \sinh\phi = \cosh\phi \tanh\phi = \gamma \frac{|v|}{c}$. Therefore, it makes sense to have $v$ have the same sign as $\phi$, meaning that as should be for a hyperbolic rotation, $b = -1, c = -1$ .   Therefore, $T = \begin{bmatrix} \cosh\phi &amp; -\sinh\phi \\ -\sinh\phi &amp; \cosh\phi \end{bmatrix}$. In terms of velocities $T = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma &amp; -\frac{v}{c} \gamma \\ -\gamma \frac{v}{c} &amp; \gamma \end{bmatrix}$</p>
<h2 id="Consequences-of-Relativity">Consequences of Relativity</h2><p>Time Dilation: Note that since events are just points in a vector space, only the distance between events is invariant as was shown. Therefore, initial conditions can be assumed to be the same without loss of generality $x' = x$ from the start of measurement. A time t passes in O. How much time t′ has passed in O’? Well,
$ct' = \gamma (ct)  -\frac{v}{c} \gamma (x^1), \gamma (x^1)  -\frac{v}{c} \gamma (ct) = 0 \Rightarrow x^1 = vt \Rightarrow ct' = ct \gamma (1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}) \Rightarrow t' = \frac{t}{\gamma}$.
This is the famous time dilation formula, where in the rest frame of an object, time is always ’slower’ than in any other frame.</p>
<p>Length contraction follows from this naturally. Consider an object at rest in O’ with length l′. What is the length of the object in O?</p>
<p>To make it more precise what measurement means in this context, consider that both frames start at the same point in spacetime. In O, the object passes by them in the time t at velocity v. In O’ the object starts at the same point as O but he measures it as having length l’. For further clarity, both frames starting at the same point mark the origin as one end of the object, and the other end of the object passes the origin at time t' in O'. A measurement is made when the object has fully passed that benchmark, which is the origin of O, but O’ has moved from. Then, $ct' = \gamma (ct) ,  -\frac{v}{c} \gamma (ct) = -l' \Rightarrow  -v \gamma t = -l' $
Since $l = v t $,
$l = \frac{l'}{\gamma}$</p>
<p>Note that time dilation and length contraction take place in two completely different frames and are not really related in a direct sense, since it would be impossible to measure the length of an object without another reference frame.</p>
<h2 id="Lorentz-Transformations-in-Other-Directions">Lorentz Transformations in Other Directions</h2><p>Now let’s expand this analysis to the y and z direction. Everything is exactly the same as it was in the $x^1$ direction since each direction is completely independent of each other. In this case,</p>
<p>$L(x_1) = \begin{bmatrix} \cosh\phi &amp; -\sinh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -\sinh\phi &amp; \cosh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \\, L(x_2) = \begin{bmatrix} \cosh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; -\sinh\phi &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -\sinh\phi &amp; 0 &amp;\cosh\phi &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \\, L(x_3) = \begin{bmatrix} \cosh\phi &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\sinh\phi \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ -\sinh\phi &amp; 0&amp; 0 &amp;\cosh\phi \end{bmatrix}$</p>
<h2 id="Velocity-Additional-Law">Velocity Additional Law</h2><p>A good portion of work has been done. The transformation laws between coordinate frames have been fully identified. Now, consider the velocity of a particle $u$ as seen from $O$. What is the velocity of the particle as seen from $O'$ traveling at velocity $v$ in the $x_1$ direction, with respect to $O$?</p>
<p>$\frac{u'}{c} = \frac{dx_{1'}}{dt'} = \frac{d(-ct\sinh\phi + x_{1}\cosh\phi)}{d(ct\cosh\phi - x_1\sinh\phi)}=\frac{-cdt\sinh\phi + dx_{1}\cosh\phi}{\cosh\phi c (dt) - dx_1 \sinh\phi} = \frac{-\tanh\phi+ \frac{u}{c}}{1  - \frac{u}{c}\tanh\phi}$
There are two ways to express this result. Defining an angle $\tanh\alpha = \frac{u}{c}$,
$\tanh\alpha ' = \frac{-\tanh\phi+ \tanh\alpha}{1  - \tanh\alpha\tanh\phi} = \tanh(\alpha - \phi)$. Velocities are additive when considered as angles. Written explicitly, however, $u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}$, which is not quite as neat.</p>
<h2 id="Relativistic-Energy-and-Momentum">Relativistic Energy and Momentum</h2><p>Now, it is possible to define the momentum of a particle in the relativistic context. Since there is no absolute time, to get a consistent definition of velocity in all frames, define $u_{\tau}' = \frac{dx'}{d\tau}$ where τ is the proper time of the object, which is the rest frame of the object. This is the frame where the object is always at rest and is unique. (If there were two such frames, v=0 between them meaning that they are essentially the same frame.) In this frame, $x = \begin{bmatrix} \tau \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$. Then, in any other frame, $x' = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma c \tau \\ \gamma v \tau \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$. Taking the velocity as defined above, $u' = \begin{bmatrix} \gamma c \\ \gamma v \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$. Note that in the rest frame of the object, $ u' = \begin{bmatrix} 1  \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$  Momentum then is naturally defined as $p' = m u = \begin{bmatrix} m\gamma c \\ m\gamma v\\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle in its rest frame. In the rest frame, the momentum takes the form $p =  \begin{bmatrix} mc \\ 0\\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $. Now, consider the magnitude of this vector as described by the metric. $p'^2 = p^2 \Rightarrow p'^2 =  (mc)^2 $ in any frame because of the invariance of the metric. Now, try to interpret each of the components of this vector. The spatial components can be defined as $p_i = \gamma m v_i$ where i describes the spatial components of the vector.</p>
<p>In the limit of small v, relativistic effects should not be as prominent and the usual results in mechanics should hold. In this case, $\gamma \approx 1$, meaning that $p_i = m v_i$ is just the standard definition of momentum. For the time component, $mc$ is the result, which seems confusing. To maybe clarify, consider expanding $\gamma$ to its first relativistic term $\gamma = (1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2})^{\frac{-1}{2}} \approx 1 + \frac{v^2}{2c^2}$. Then, $p_0 \approx  mc(1 + \frac{v^2}{2c^2}) = mc + \frac{m}{2c}v^2$. Dividing by $c$, $\frac{p_0}{c} = m + \frac{m}{2}v^2$. The second term is just the kinetic energy as usually defined in mechanics. The first term is called the rest energy of a particle and is not seen in regular mechanics because it is a constant (Note that only changes in energy are measured in classical mechanics). Therefore, it makes sense to define the quantity $\frac{p_0}{c} = E$, where $E$ is the energy of the particle. This would include the rest energy and any other forms of energy, and is of course frame dependent. The momentum vector in Lorentzian space time in all its components is, $p =  \begin{bmatrix} \frac{E}{c}\\ p_1\\ p_2 \\ p_3 \end{bmatrix} $. Looking at the magnitude $p^2 = \frac{E^2}{c^2} - (p_i)^2 = m^2c^2$. In the rest frame of the particle, $E^2 = m^2 c^4 \Rightarrow E = mc^2$. The most famous equation in physics, or most well-known, describes the rest energy of a particle.</p>
