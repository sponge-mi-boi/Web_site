<h1 id="General-Invariance-and-Covariance">General Invariance and Covariance<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Invariance-and-Covariance"></a></h1><p>Now, let's recap the geometric structure of Minkowski space and the objects which have been defined on it. This is a vector space, 4 dimensional, and if one ignores the metric, it is essentially just $R^4$, which is 4 dimensional Euclidean space. However, because of the metric $\eta$ that is defined with a signature of plus and minus, this space is called a Lorentzian vector space, meaning that the metric is not always positive. There can be negative measures of distance, and even 0 measures of distance, which are not really possible with the usual metric of all positive signatures. A point on this spacetime, or vector space as is the more mathematical term, is defined in terms of a time component and 3 spatial components. This is the physical meaning one gives to this mathematical 4 dimensional vector. Similarly, there is a dual vector space and one can form tensor spaces of arbitrary rank in the usual way, as for any vector space. There was also a energy momentum vector defined, which also naturally transformed as a vector in this space. It is easy to see that this is merely a Fourier transform, or conjugates via it, of time and the position variables in the usual sense. Only the metric tensor is needed to be specified from physical principles, and given a metric, one can form a curvature tensor by forming a covariant derivative, etc. Other than this, what other objects can be defined?</p>
<p>It turned out that the electric and magnetic fields are naturally displayed as part of a 2 dimensional tensor and Maxwell's equations are just tensor equations in disguise. It was formed from the 4 potential vector defined in this space and given in terms of the current density vector also on this space. These are vectors whose magnitudes are invariant under Lorentz transformations, as is true for all vectors in this space. This means that the components of these vectors transform as vector components in the traditional sense. To quantify this, $(x,y)$ let's use to describe the inner product of two vectors on this space. Then, $(x,y) = g_{uv}x^uy^v$ by definition is the distance between these two points, or vectors, and this quantity is conserved under Lorentz transformations, $L(\hat{r})$, which indicates a Lorentz transformation in the direction in which $\hat{r}$ points. This is a linear transformation, represented by the matrix, whose components are $\lambda^u_v$. For $(x,y)$ to be invariant under a transformation $L(x) = x' \Rightarrow x^{u'} = \lambda^{u'}_u x^u$, $(x',y') = (x,y) \Rightarrow g_{u'v'}x^{u'}y^{v'} = g_{uv}x^uy^v \Rightarrow g_{u'v'}\lambda^{u'}_u x^u\lambda^{v'}_v x^v = g_{uv}x^uy^v$. This implies $ g_{u'v'} \lambda^{u'}_u \lambda^{v'}_v = g_{uv}$. This confirms that the definition given is consistent, meaning that $g$ transforms as a tensor, which just means that each index component transforms as a vector would. (Tensors are made from independent linear operations, specifically tensor products, of vectors recall). This means that the electromagnetic tensor $F$ should also transform as a tensor.</p>
<p>$A$ the potential vector has 4 components and transforms in each of its components independently. It is a vector field, meaning it has a different assigned vector value on every point on spacetime. A transformation of coordinates just means that each vector of this vector field transforms in the same way. A scalar field has a single value at each point in spacetime. A transformation of coordinates merely shifts the position label, but there is no components, so of course its value itself does not change. This is represented by $\phi(x') = \phi(\lambda^{-1} x)$ for a scalar field $\phi(x)$. This is called a passive transformation, meaning the fields are kept stationary. Of course, one can take the field itself to be shifted, but there is really no difference in both aspects for physical theories. There can be tensor fields, which is what the EM tensor is since its components depend on position, too.</p>
<h1 id="Lagrangian-Constructions">Lagrangian Constructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lagrangian-Constructions"></a></h1><p>How does one create equations of motion from these fields? The Lagrangian formulation is natural. For a particle in classical mechanics described by a function $x(t)$ in 1 dimension let's say in free motion, the Lagrangian would be given by $L = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{x}^2$. t is the independent variable and a particle is described by its physical position. The position variable is called the state variable of the system and the number of state variables is the degrees of freedom of the system. For a 1-dimensional motion particle, there is only one state variable. To expand this to the case of Minkowski spacetime, or even field theory in general, time and all the spatial positions need to be on equal footing. Therefore, the number of independent variables is now 4, described by $x^\alpha$, which are just each of the spacetime coordinates. Now, consider a particle described by a scalar field $\phi$ on the spacetime. The principle of relativity tells us that the Lagrangians which we create or use to attempt to describe the physical systems should be Lorentz invariant, meaning it should be independent of reference frame. It should also represent the notion of energy as it is commonly considered in classical mechanics for individual particles. Then, $\phi$ is Lorentz invariant by definition since it s a scalar field. Any polynomial term in $\phi$ is also Lorentz invariant, such as $\phi^n , n \in \mathcal Z$. These are actually commonly used in quantum field theory for modeling actually. The operator $\partial^2$ is also Lorentz invariant. For a scalar field, the simplest Lagrangian that can be made is then $L = A \phi \partial^2 \phi + B \phi^2$. The polynomial term is quadratic to ensure consistency with the expectation that energy is quadratic in position usually in classical mechanics. Usually $A = \frac{1}{2}, B = m^2$ is taken for convenience where m in this context is just a real number, but later can naturally be considered as the mass of the scalar particle. Note here that $L$ is taken to be a function of $\phi$ and $\partial_\alpha \phi$. Therefore, for one scalar field, there are 5 explict dependent variables in the Lagrangian, but only 1 degree of freedom needed to describe the system.</p>
<p>In general for a scalar field $\phi = \phi(x)$, $L = L(\phi,\partial_u \phi)$. This can be solved with the Lagrange equations $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \phi} = \partial_u\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_u \phi)} $. The important aspect here is to look at the variation of the action $\int \delta L \, \,  d^4 x $. Here $\delta L = \partial_\phi L \delta \phi + (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L) \delta (\partial_u \phi) = \partial_\phi L \delta \phi + (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L)  \partial_u (\delta\phi)$, where the variation commutes with the derivative because the variation is just made up of derivatives essentially. Using integration by parts,</p>
<p>$\partial_\phi L \delta \phi -\partial_u (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L) \delta (\phi) + \partial_u (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \delta (\phi)) = 0$. Then, using the Lagrange equations the first two terms cancel. If the last term is true for parts of spacetime, meaning $\delta L d^4 x = 0, \forall dx$(essentially the Lagrangian itself is invariant), then $ \partial_u (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \delta (\phi)) = 0.$ Defining $j^u = \frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \delta (\phi)$, $\partial_u j^u = 0$. There is a vector whose divergence is 0 if the Lagrangian is locally invariant under the variation of one of its variables, in this case the state variable.</p>
<p>Then, $\partial_u j^ u = 0 \Rightarrow \partial_t j^ 0 = -\partial_ i j^ i$. Defining the current $j^0$ and the current density vector $\vec{j}, j^i$, $\partial_t j^0 = -\nabla \cdot \vec{j}$. Integrating over a volume in spacetime with a fixed time, one gets the charge $\int d^3x \dot{j^0} = \dot{Q} = - \int d^3x \nabla \cdot \vec j = -\int da \cdot \vec j  = 0$ where Stokes theorem was used and the current density was taken to vanish at infinity, which for physical systems should be true. Then, $Q = \int dV j^0$ is conserved. The invariance of $L$ under the variation of it state variable results in a conserved charge. Since this was done independent of the form of the state variable, this means that every continious symmetry in the action defined by the Lagrangian with respect to a state variable corresponds to a conserved charge/current over the spacetime.</p>
<h1 id="Canonical-Stress-Energy-Tensor">Canonical Stress-Energy Tensor<a class="anchor-link" href="#Canonical-Stress-Energy-Tensor"></a></h1><p>This is actually true if the Lagrangian is varied with respect to even its independent variables. A variation in the state variable, in this case the field, can be described as $\delta \phi = -\partial_v \phi \delta x^v = -g_{uv}\partial^u \phi \delta x^v$. Note the negative sign because scalar fields are taken to transform passively. Therefore, $\delta L = \partial_\phi L \delta \phi + (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L) \delta (\partial_u \phi) +\partial_u L \delta x^u = \partial_\phi L \delta \phi - \partial_u (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L) \delta \phi +\partial_u (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \delta \phi)  +  \partial_u L \delta x^u $
$ = -\partial_u (\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \partial_v \phi \delta x^v)  +  \partial_u L \delta x^u = \partial_u(\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \partial_v \phi \delta x^v  +  L g^u_v\delta x^v)= \partial_u(-\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \partial_v \phi  +  L g^u_v)\delta x^v$. The quantity$ -T^u_v = -\frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial_u \phi)} L \partial_v \phi  +  L g^u_v$ by convention, meaning that $T_{uv} = \frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial^u \phi)} L \partial_v \phi  -  L g_{uv}$. This is the energy momentum tensor (the canonical version), meaning that $\partial^u T_{uv} = 0$. To understand its name, consider the 4 separate cases of its components, $0,0; 0,i; i,0; i,j$, and take the Lorentz invariant scalar field Lagrangian given above $L = A \phi \partial^2 \phi + B \phi^2$. In this case, $T_{uv} = \frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial^u \phi)} (A \phi \partial^2 \phi) \partial_v \phi  -   g_{uv}(A \phi \partial^2 \phi + B \phi^2)$. Note that $L$ is a function of $\partial_u \phi$ meaning the derivative term $\phi \partial^2 \phi = \partial^u \partial_u \phi(\phi) = -\partial^u \phi \partial_u \phi$ by integration by parts. Then, take $A \rightarrow -A$ by just redefining a constant, meaning that $T_{uv} = \frac {\partial}{\partial(\partial^u \phi)} (A \partial^\alpha \phi \partial_\alpha \phi) \partial_v \phi  -   g_{uv}(A \partial^\alpha \phi \partial_\alpha \phi + B \phi^2) = 2A \partial_u \phi \partial_v \phi -  g_{uv}(A \partial^\alpha \phi \partial_\alpha \phi + B \phi^2) $. Then $T_{00} = 2A (\partial_0 \phi)^2 - A(\partial_\alpha \phi)^2 - B \phi^2 = A(\partial_0 \phi)^2 + A (\partial_i \phi)^2 - B \phi^2 $ . Defining $A = \frac{1}{2}, B = -m^2$, $T_{00} = \frac{1}{2}((\partial_t \phi)^2 + (\nabla \phi)^2) + m^2 \phi^2 = K + U = \epsilon$. Therefore, $T_{00}$ is just the energy density of the system. Similarly, $T_{0i} = 2A (\partial_0\phi) (\partial_i\phi) = \frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x^i}$. This can be interpreted as the flow of momentum in the $x^i$ direction, since the canonical momentum is $\pi = \frac{\partial}{\partial(\partial_0 \phi)}L = \partial_0 \phi$, giving this interpretation more validity. In this case, $T$ is seen to be naturally symmetric meaning that $T_{0i} = T_{i0}$.  Then, $T_{ij} = \partial_i \phi \partial_j \phi $ if $ i\neq j$. This has an interpretation of shear pressure. $T_{ii}$ has a similar interpretation too which will make more sense with examples.</p>
<p>Going back to creating Lorentz invariant Lagrangians, consider a vector field such as the electromagnetic potential $A$. Possible invariant terms include $A_uA^u =A^2, d_uA^u$ or any polynomial formed from them. However, there is a natural tensor created from $A$, which is of course $F$ and contracting its indices would result in an invariant quantity. The first order contraction $F^u_u$ is just 0 since it is anti-symmetric. Therefore, consider the second order contraction $F_{uv}F^{uv}$. The simplest possible Lagrangian which is Lorentz invariant that can be created from $F$ is then $L = C F_{uv}F^{uv}$ where $C = -\frac{1}{4}$ usually to simplify calculations. Writing this out explicitly $L = C (\partial_u A_v - \partial_v A_u)(\partial^uA^v - \partial^v A^u)$
$= C(-\partial^2A^vA_v + A_v\partial_u\partial^vA^u + A_u\partial_v\partial^uA^v - \partial^2 A_u A^u) = 2C(-\partial^2 A_u A^u- (\partial_u A^u)^2)$ $= \frac{1}{2}(\partial^2 A_u A^u + (\partial_u A^u)^2)$. These are the only two natural quadratic potential terms which are Lorentz invariant that can be included in the Lagrangian for a vector field.</p>
