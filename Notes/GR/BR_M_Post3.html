<h1 id="Spinors">Spinors<a class="anchor-link" href="#Spinors"></a></h1><p>Now, let's look at a slightly different topic, seemingly unrelated, but actually very essential in modern theoretical physics, which is spinors. There are many ways to approach the study of spinors and their uses, but here I will use a general approach and give as much depth as needed to understand really what is going on.</p>
<h2 id="Complex-Vector-space">Complex Vector space<a class="anchor-link" href="#Complex-Vector-space"></a></h2><p>Recall the definition of a vector space, which has the essential requirements of scalar multiplication and vector addition.
For complex vector spaces, vector addition works the similar with each component adding to each other by the addition of complex numbers. However, scalar multiplication can be slightly different.
Consider $v, w \in V$ where V is a complex vector space of $n$ complex dimensions ($2n$ real dimensions). Given a complex number $\lambda = a + b i = r e^{i \theta}\in \mathcal{C}$ one way to define scalar multiplication is $ \lambda \cdot v = \lambda \cdot \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ ... \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \lambda v_1 \\ ... \\ \lambda v_n \end{bmatrix}$. Another way is to define the multiplication as  $ \lambda \cdot v = \lambda \cdot \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ ... \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} \bar{\lambda} v_1 \\ ... \\ \bar\lambda v_n \end{bmatrix}$, multiplying by the complex conjugate of the scalar instead. The existence of a complex vector space implies the existence of a complex conjugate vector space by this different representation of scalar multiplication on that vector space. This is in similarity to how a vector space implies the existence of a dual vector space. In fact, for mplex vector spaces, the existence of a complex dual vector space is also implied as the set of all linear, complex functions from $V$ to $\mathcal{C}$. The proof is exactly similar to the real vector field case.</p>
<p>Furthermore, note that the existence of a complex conjugate vector space would imply the existence of a complex conjugate dual vector space. Therefore, the existence of a complex vector space $\mathcal{V_C}$ implies the existence of three other vector spaces $\mathcal{V_C}^*, \bar{\mathcal{V_C}}, \bar{\mathcal{V_C}^*}$.</p>
<p>The question arises what this has to do with relativity at all and what is the use of this if it does relate. Lorentz spacetime is the set of all vectors such that the distance between two points on this spacetime, both of which are described by a vector, remains invariant. The entire structure of this framework can be analyzed as follows. There is a defined vector space, which is the fundamental object in all of this. There is also a metric to give a measure of distance, described by the metric tensor.</p>
<h2 id="Spinor-Defintion-and-Metric">Spinor Defintion and Metric<a class="anchor-link" href="#Spinor-Defintion-and-Metric"></a></h2><p>In exact analogy, consider a different vector space, not the 4 dimensional space of relativity, but rather 2 dimensional complex vector space. Note this is also 4 total dimensions because of course each complex number is described by two real numbers. Instead of the scalar product given by the metric $g_{uv}x^uy^v$ for vectors $x,y$, consider the scalar product defined by the metric $\epsilon$ such that $\epsilon_{AB}\alpha^A \phi^B$ for two complex dimensional vectors which exist on this complex dimensional vector space $\alpha = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2 \end{bmatrix}, \phi =  \begin{bmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{bmatrix}$. Note these vectors are defined by two complex numbers each, as is expected $\alpha_A, \phi_A \in \mathcal{C}$. The metric in this case is defined to be completely anti-symmetric and of course $2 \times 2$ complex dimensional, $\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}$  . Given that the indices $A,B \in \{1,2\}$, $\epsilon_{AA} = 0, \epsilon_{AB} = -\epsilon_{BA}, B \neq A$. Then, $\epsilon_{AB}\alpha^A \phi^B = \epsilon_{BA}\alpha^B \phi^A = -\epsilon_{AB}\alpha^B \phi^A$ . It has an inverse defined $\epsilon^{AB}\epsilon_{BC} = \delta^A_C$. Writing out the inner product, $ -\alpha_1 \phi_2 + \alpha_2 \phi_1 $.Note, however in this case, if the magnitude of just a single two dimensional complex vector is taken, the result is $\epsilon_{AB}{\alpha^A}{\alpha^B} = -\alpha_1 \alpha_2 + \alpha_2 \alpha_1 = 0$.All vectors in this vector space then have no magnitude and share a similarity with null vectors in regular Lorentzian spacetime.</p>
<p>Now, just like the derivations for Lorentz transformations, what are the transformations that leave the metric invariant? . Consider a transformation $T: \phi \rightarrow \phi' = T(\phi)$. In matrix and vector form, $\begin{bmatrix} \phi_{1'} \\ \phi_{2'} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} T_{1'1} &amp; T_{1'2} \\ T_{2'1} &amp; T_{2'2}  \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{bmatrix}$. Then, $\epsilon_{A'B'}\alpha^{A'} \phi^{B'} = -\alpha_{1'} \phi_{2'} + \alpha_{2'} \phi_{1'} $</p>
<p>$= -(T_{1'1}\alpha_{1} + T_{1'2}\alpha_2)(T_{2'1}\phi_1 + T_{2'2}\phi_2) +(T_{2'1}\alpha_{1} + T_{2'2}\alpha_2)(T_{1'1}\phi_1 + T_{1'2}\phi_2)= (T_{2'1}T_{1'2} - T_{1'1}T_{2'2})\phi_1\alpha_2 -  (-T_{2'1}T_{1'2} + T_{1'1}T_{2'2})\phi_2\alpha_1  =  -\alpha_1 \phi_2 + \alpha_2 \phi_1$</p>
<p>Then, the invariance of the metric implies $-T_{2'1}T_{1'2} + T_{1'1}T_{2'2} = 1$. Note the quantity is just the determinant of $T$, meaning that $\det(T) = 1$, called uni modularity in the context of complex vector spaces, is the condition for the metric as defined to be conserved.</p>
<p>Note the existence of the metric implies that as in the situation in Lorentzian spacetime and in general real vector spaces, one can associate a dual complex vector with each complex vector. Given a vector $v$, its dual $v^*$ is defined as $\epsilon_{AB}v^B = v_A $. This is the 1-1 correspondence between vectors and their duals with the mapping defined by the metric, as in the case of real vector fields. However, note the existence of the complex conjugate vector space implies that one can define these same relations in that vector space, meaning a similar metric $\epsilon$ can be defined and the complex conjugate of the vectors are used instead. To differentiate this complex conjugate vector space against the regular vector space, the symbol $\phi_{\dot{A}}$ is used for $\phi \in \mathcal{\bar{V_C}}$. The 1-1 mapping between $\mathcal{V_C}$ and $\mathcal{\bar{V_C}}$ is as expected $ \phi = \begin{bmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{bmatrix} \Leftrightarrow \bar\phi = \begin{bmatrix} \bar\phi_1 \\ \bar\phi_2 \end{bmatrix}$. Note then by the notation defined earlier $\phi_\dot{A} = \bar\phi_A \Leftrightarrow \phi_A$. The metric in this space is then $\epsilon_{\dot{A}\dot{B}}$.</p>
<p>Note the two spaces are equivalent with the defined metric. The derivations for $\mathcal{\bar{V_C}}$ transforming under unimodular transformations to preserve its metric is identical in comparison to $\mathcal{V_C}$.</p>
<p>The two component complex vector which transforms under unimodular transformations and preserves the metric defined above are called spinors. Just like vectors in Lorentzian spacetime, tensors can be formed from the tensor product of individual spinors $\alpha = \alpha^A e_A$ ($\{e_A\}$ are the complex basis vectors in $\mathcal{V_C}$), their complex conjugates $\bar{\alpha} = \bar{\alpha}^A \bar{e}_A$ ($\{\bar{e}_A\}$ are the complex basis vectors in $\mathcal{\bar C}$), their duals  $\alpha^* = \alpha_A w^A$ ($\{w^A\}$ are the complex dual basis vectors in $\mathcal{C^*}$), and their complex duals $\bar\alpha^* = \bar\alpha_A \bar w^A$ ($\{\bar w^A\}$. Examples are seen easily from a $2 \times 2$ dimensional complex tensor made from $\mathcal{V_C}$ such as  $\gamma^{AB} e_A e_B = \gamma, \gamma_{AB} w^A w^B = \gamma^*, \gamma^{\dot{A}\dot B} e_{\dot A} e_\dot{B} = \bar\gamma$, and $\gamma_{\dot A \dot B} w^\dot A w^ \dot B = \bar\gamma^*$. Note these spaces exist without the metric even of course, but a metric is needed to map $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal{\bar C}$ to their duals.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to even mix indices to define new tensors. The best example is the spinor tensor $\sigma_{A\dot{B}}$.</p>
<h2 id="Spinors-Mapping-to-Lorentzian-Vectors">Spinors Mapping to Lorentzian Vectors<a class="anchor-link" href="#Spinors-Mapping-to-Lorentzian-Vectors"></a></h2><p>Consider now the possibility of relating the set of $2 \times 2$ spinors to the set of 4-dimensional vectors in Lorentzian spacetime. The question arises that why is this even being thought of and if there is any intuition behind it.</p>
<p>To answer this, consider the matrix $\begin{bmatrix} x_0 + x_3 &amp; x_1 - ix_2 \\x_1 + ix_2 &amp; x_0 - x_3 \end{bmatrix}$ where the $\{x_\alpha\}$ are real numbers. This seems ridiculously random, but it makes sense when one considers the $x_\alpha$ to be the components of a Lorentz vector $\begin{bmatrix} x_0  \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}$, since the determinant of the matrix $(x_0 + x_3) (x_0 - x_3) -  (x_1 - ix_2) (x_1 + ix_2) = x_0^2 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 -x_3^2 $ is the metric of Lorentzian spacetime. Note its possible also to break up the matrix as follows $\begin{bmatrix} x_0  &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; x_0 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} x_3  &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -x_3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; x_1 \\x_1  &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0  &amp; -ix_2 \\ ix_2  &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} = x_0 I + x_3\sigma^3 + x_1 \sigma^1 + x_2 \sigma^2 = x_\alpha \sigma^\alpha$ where the $\{\sigma\}$ matrices are the Pauli matrices along with identity matrix for the 0th component. This means that the set of all transformations which preserve the determinant of the matrix should be considered Lorentz transformations. Furthermore, note that it is possible to define a 1-1 correspondence between the set of all matrices of the form given above and the set of all vectors in Lorentzian spacetime in the obvious way.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with spinors? The $\sigma_i$ matrices allow a natural association of vectors with two dimensional spinors by way of the mapping $x^\alpha = \sigma^\alpha_{A\dot{B}}\phi^{A\dot{B}}$ where $\phi$ is a two dimensional mixed spinor.</p>
