<h1 id="Covariant-Derivative">Covariant Derivative<a class="anchor-link" href="#Covariant-Derivative">¶</a></h1><p>Similar to the exterior derivative, another derivative of at most importance that can be defined on spacetime is the covariant derivative. This actually has been seen already in the derivation of the geodesic equation from the Lagrangian of a free particle. The geodesic equation is $\ddot{x}^\sigma + \Gamma^\sigma _{\gamma \alpha} \dot{x}^\gamma\dot{x}^\alpha = 0$ for a particle traveling along a curve described by vector $x$, and the Christoffel symbols are $\Gamma^\sigma _{\gamma \alpha} = \frac{-1}{2}g^{\sigma v}(\partial_v(g_{\alpha\gamma})  + \partial_\gamma (g_{v\alpha}) + \partial_\alpha (g_{v\gamma}))$. These arose due to the metric being a function of $x$. Of course, the metric could be a function of spacetime, but the spacetime could still be flat depending on the coordinates used, meaning that the Riemann tensor had to be defined to look at the 2nd order variation in the metric to decide if there was a non-zero curvature in the spacetime. $R^\alpha_{v\eta u} = -\partial_u\Gamma_{\eta v}^\alpha  + \partial_ \eta\Gamma_{uv}^\alpha - \Gamma_{u\sigma}^\alpha \Gamma_{\eta v}^\sigma  + \Gamma_{\eta \sigma}^\alpha \Gamma _ {uv} ^ \sigma$. This arose from the calculation of the geodesic deviation at a point, defined by the 2nd order quantity  $\frac{D^2}{DrD\lambda}\dot{x} $ vanishing at a point for a flat spacetime. This operator $\frac{D}{D \lambda}  = \frac{ \partial}{\partial \lambda} + \Gamma \frac{ \partial}{\partial r} \frac{ \partial }{\partial r}$ is the covariant derivative. It has already been naturally defined, but it can be looked at closer. It is the total change in a vector if the basis vectors of a coordinate system are not constant. For example, a vector $v$ on the spacetime at a point $x$ in some local coordinate system $v = v^\alpha e_\alpha$. To calculate the change in this vector in some direction described by the vector $\partial_u$, $\partial_u(v^\alpha e_\alpha) = \partial_u(v^\alpha)e_\alpha + v^\alpha \partial_ue_\alpha$. The basis vectors are not usually constant, $\partial_u e_\alpha = \Gamma_{u\alpha}^\eta e_\eta$. The $\Gamma_{u\alpha}^\eta$ are just the components of the change in the $\alpha$ basis vector in each of the other basis vectors directions, including itself.  Then, $\partial_u(v^\alpha e_\alpha) = \partial_u(v^\alpha)e_\alpha + v^\alpha \Gamma_{u\alpha}^\eta e_\eta$. Relabeling by switching the indices of the $\eta$ in the second term to $\alpha$, $\partial_u(v^\alpha e_\alpha) = \partial_u(v^\eta)e_\eta+ v^\alpha \Gamma_{u\alpha}^\eta e_\eta = (\partial_u v^\alpha+ v^\eta \Gamma_{u\eta}^\alpha) e_\alpha $. Therefore, $\nabla_u v^\alpha = \partial_u v^\alpha + \Gamma_{u\beta}^\alpha v^\beta $.</p>
<p>Now consider the covariant derivative for a dual vector $ r = r_\alpha w^\alpha$. By the definition of the dual $w^\alpha e_\beta = c, c \in \mathcal{R}$ (usually 1). Then, $\nabla_u(w^\alpha e_\beta) = \nabla_u(w^\alpha) e_\beta + w^\alpha \Gamma_{u\beta}^\eta e_\eta = 0 \Rightarrow  \nabla_u(w^\alpha)e_\beta =  -w^\alpha \Gamma_{u\beta}^\eta e_\eta$. Setting $\alpha = \beta$ and then interchanging indices,  $\nabla_u(w^\alpha)e_\alpha =  -w^\alpha \Gamma_{u\alpha}^\eta e_\eta \Rightarrow$ means that $\nabla_u(w^\alpha) =  -w^\eta \Gamma_{u\eta}^\alpha$. Therefore, $\nabla_u(r_\alpha) = \partial_u (r_\alpha) - r_\beta \Gamma^\beta_{u\alpha}$. Tensors transform as expected, since each index is independently transformed from the other. For an example, consider a tensor of rank $(0,2)$, $\nabla_\alpha T_{uv} = \partial_\alpha T_{uv} - \Gamma^\beta_{u \alpha}T_{\beta v} - \Gamma^\beta_{v \alpha}T_{u \beta}$</p>
<p>An important note is that the definition of the covariant derivative is frame independent from its creation. $\nabla_w v$ describes how much a vector $v$ changes in the direction of another vector $w$. Vectors are of course geometrical entities and only the components of the metric change in different coordinate frames as the basis vectors also change.</p>
<h1 id="Invariance-of-the-Metric">Invariance of the Metric<a class="anchor-link" href="#Invariance-of-the-Metric">¶</a></h1><p>The metric is an important example because by the equivalence principle, there is a frame where $\eta_{uv}$ is the form of the metric. Taking the covariant derivative $\nabla_\alpha (\eta_{uv}) = 0$ since it is just a constant. However, note that $\nabla g = 0$ is a coordinate independent statement. Therefore, $\nabla g = 0$ is true in any coordinate frame.</p>
<h1 id="Riemann-Tensor:-Alternate-Derivation">Riemann Tensor: Alternate Derivation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Riemann-Tensor:-Alternate-Derivation">¶</a></h1><p>Let's look at another derivation of the Riemann tensor. It describes the second order change in the metric, which motivates the following setup. Consider moving a vector $e_\beta$, parallel transporting, around a parallelogram, or infinitesimal rectangle. Define the horizontal sides of the rectangle to point in the $\partial_u$ direction and the vertical sides to point in the $\partial_v$ direction. What is the change in the vector if it is moved around this whole rectangle? This is described best by $(\nabla_u \nabla_v - \nabla_v \nabla_u) e_\beta = [\nabla_u,\nabla_v] e_\beta$. If this quantity is 0, there is no change in the vector, meaning there is no second order deviation in the metric, meaning that one can assume the spacetime is flat if this is true for all points in the spacetime. Explicitly $(\nabla_u \nabla_v) e_\beta = \nabla_u( \Gamma_{v \beta}^\sigma e_\sigma) = \partial_u (\Gamma_{v \beta}^\sigma) e_\sigma + \Gamma_{u \sigma}^\eta e_\eta  \Gamma_{v\beta}^\sigma  \Rightarrow [\nabla_u,\nabla_v] e_\beta = \partial_u (\Gamma_{v \beta}^\sigma) e_\sigma + \Gamma_{u \sigma}^\eta e_\eta  \Gamma_{v\beta}^\sigma - \partial_v (\Gamma_{u \beta}^\sigma) e_\sigma - \Gamma_{v \sigma}^\eta e_\eta  \Gamma_{u \beta}^\sigma$
$= (\partial_u (\Gamma_{v \beta}^\eta) - \partial_v (\Gamma_{u \beta}^\eta) + \Gamma_{u \sigma}^\eta  \Gamma_{v\beta}^\sigma - \Gamma_{v \sigma}^\eta   \Gamma_{u \beta}^\sigma)e_\eta = R^\eta_{\beta uv}e_\eta$. This means $R^\eta_{\beta uv} = \partial_u (\Gamma_{v \beta}^\eta) - \partial_v (\Gamma_{u \beta}^\eta) + \Gamma_{u \sigma}^\eta  \Gamma_{v\beta}^\sigma - \Gamma_{v \sigma}^\eta   \Gamma_{u \beta}^\sigma$ which matches the definition from earlier. The tensor has many symmetries which are easier to see in a locally Minkowski coordinate system, geodesic coordinates. In a locally geodesic coordinate system the Christoffel symbols locally vanish $\Gamma^u_{v \alpha} = 0$, but of course the second derivatives do not. Therefore, the Riemann Tensor takes the form $R^\eta_{\beta uv} = \partial_u (\Gamma_{v \beta}^\eta) - \partial_v (\Gamma_{u \beta}^\eta)$.</p>
<p>Lowering the $\eta$ index, $ g_{\eta \gamma}R^\eta_{\beta uv} = g_{\eta \gamma}\partial_u (\Gamma_{v \beta}^\eta) - g_{\eta \gamma}\partial_v (\Gamma_{u \beta}^\eta) = \partial_u (g_{\eta \gamma}\Gamma_{v \beta}^\eta) - \partial_v (g_{\eta \gamma}\Gamma_{u \beta}^\eta)$.</p>
<p>Since  $\Gamma^\sigma _{\gamma \alpha} = \frac{-1}{2}g^{\sigma v}(\partial_v(g_{\alpha\gamma})  - \partial_\gamma (g_{v\alpha}) - \partial_\alpha (g_{v\gamma}))$, then $\frac{-1}{2}\delta_\gamma^\sigma (\partial_u (\partial_\sigma g_{v\beta}  - \partial_\beta g_{\sigma v} - \partial_ v g_{\sigma \beta }) - \partial_v (\partial_\sigma g_{\beta u}  - \partial_u g_{\sigma\beta} - \partial_\beta g_{\sigma u})) $
$= \frac{-1}{2} (\partial_u (\partial_\gamma g_{v\beta}  - \partial_\beta g_{\gamma v} - \partial_ v g_{\gamma \beta }) - \partial_v (\partial_\gamma g_{\beta u}  - \partial_u g_{\gamma\beta} - \partial_\beta g_{\gamma u})) $.</p>
<p>Then, $R_{\gamma \beta u v} = \frac{-1}{2} (\partial_u \partial_\gamma g_{v\beta}  - \partial_u \partial_\beta g_{\gamma v} - \partial_v \partial_\gamma g_{\beta u}  + \partial_v \partial_\beta g_{\gamma u})$.</p>
<h1 id="Riemann-Tensor-Symmetries">Riemann Tensor Symmetries<a class="anchor-link" href="#Riemann-Tensor-Symmetries">¶</a></h1><p>The symmetries are much easier to see now. Consider the interchange of the first and second index, the third and fourth index, and the first and second pair of indices. In the first case, $R_{\gamma \beta u v} \rightarrow R_{\beta \gamma u v} = -\frac{1}{2} (\partial_u \partial_\beta g_{v\gamma}  - \partial_u \partial_\gamma g_{\beta v} - \partial_v \partial_\beta g_{\gamma u}  + \partial_v \partial_\gamma g_{\beta u}) = \frac{1}{2} (-\partial_u \partial_\beta g_{v\gamma}  + \partial_u \partial_\gamma g_{\beta v} + \partial_v \partial_\beta g_{\gamma u}  - \partial_v \partial_\gamma g_{\beta u}) = -R_{\gamma \beta u v} $. The second was already proven, and the third is easy to see. $R_{\gamma \beta u v} = -R_{\gamma \beta v u} = R_{u v \gamma \beta}$. These symmetries partly reduce the components of the Riemann from $4^4 \rightarrow 6^2$ (two independent anti-symmetries). The symmetry of the pairs reduces this further into a symmetric matrix, which means $21$ independent components. However, there is another symmetry, where $R$ satisfies the Jacobi Identity on the last three indices, meaning $R_{\gamma [\beta u v]} = 0$. This is one other constraint equation, meaning that the total number of independent components of the Riemann tensor is $20$.</p>
<p>These symmetries mean that contraction of its indices can make only one independent tensor, defined as the Ricci tensor by contraction on the first and third indices $R^\gamma_{u \gamma v} = R_{uv}$. The pair index symmetry ensures that this tensor is symmetric $R_{uv} = R_{vu}$, meaning it has only 10 independent components. The trace of this tensor can be taken meaning $R = R^u_u$, called the Ricci scalar. All of these are different measures of curvature used in different contexts.</p>
<p>The Riemann tensor can be broken further into terms involving the Ricci tensor and terms without it. The Ricci tensor is the contractable part of the Riemann tensor and the Weyl tensor, defined as the part of the Riemann tensor which cannot be contracted into a non-zero term, is the other part. Therefore, the remaining 10 components not in the Ricci tensor are encoded in the Weyl tensor. This is the definition of the Weyl tensor and will be explored later.</p>
<h1 id="The-Bianchi-Identities">The Bianchi Identities<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Bianchi-Identities">¶</a></h1><p>There can now be a proof of the Bianchi identity. It is actually straightforward from the Jacobi identity which commutators satisfy $[\nabla_\alpha, [\nabla_u,\nabla_v]] + [\nabla_v, [\nabla_\alpha,\nabla_u]] + [\nabla_u, [\nabla_v,\nabla_\alpha]] = 0$. By definition, applying to a vector $e_\beta$, then $ ([\nabla_\alpha, [\nabla_u,\nabla_v]] + [\nabla_v, [\nabla_\alpha,\nabla_u]] + [\nabla_u, [\nabla_v,\nabla_\alpha]]) e_\beta$<br/>
$= \nabla_\alpha [\nabla_u,\nabla_v] e_\beta -  [\nabla_u,\nabla_v] \nabla_\alpha e_\beta + \nabla_v[\nabla_\alpha,\nabla_u] e_\beta - [\nabla_\alpha,\nabla_u] \nabla_v e_\beta +\nabla_u [\nabla_v,\nabla_\alpha] e_\beta - [\nabla_v,\nabla_\alpha]\nabla_u e_\beta$
$= (\nabla_\alpha R^\gamma_{\beta uv} + \nabla_v R^\gamma_{\beta \alpha u} + \nabla_u R^\gamma_{\beta v\alpha}) e_\gamma - 
( [\nabla_u,\nabla_v] \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^\sigma  + [\nabla_\alpha,\nabla_u]\Gamma_{v \beta}^\sigma + [\nabla_v,\nabla_\alpha]\Gamma_{u \beta}^\sigma) e_\sigma$
$= (\nabla_\alpha R^\gamma_{\beta uv} + \nabla_v R^\gamma_{\beta \alpha u} + \nabla_u R^\gamma_{\beta v\alpha} - 
 [\nabla_u,\nabla_v] \Gamma_{\alpha \beta}^\gamma  - [\nabla_\alpha,\nabla_u]\Gamma_{v \beta}^\gamma - [\nabla_v,\nabla_\alpha]\Gamma_{u \beta}^\gamma) e_\gamma $. Going to a frame where the Christoffel symbols vanish $ (\nabla_\alpha R^\gamma_{\beta uv} + \nabla_v R^\gamma_{\beta \alpha u} + \nabla_u R^\gamma_{\beta v\alpha})e_\gamma = 0$. This is a coordinate independent equation meaning that it is true in all reference frames. Therefore, $\nabla_\alpha R^\gamma_{\beta uv} + \nabla_v R^\gamma_{\beta \alpha u} + \nabla_u R^\gamma_{\beta v\alpha} = \nabla_{[\alpha} R^\gamma_{|\beta| uv]} = 0$. This is the Bianchi identity. Note it is essentially 3 independent equations.</p>
<h1 id="The-Einstein-Tensor">The Einstein Tensor<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Einstein-Tensor">¶</a></h1><p>Now, let's contract the Bianchi identities, specifically the first and last, meaning derivative, indices. $\nabla_\alpha R^\alpha_{\beta uv} + \nabla_v R^\alpha_{\beta \alpha u} + \nabla_u R^\alpha_{\beta v\alpha} = \nabla_\alpha R^\alpha_{\beta uv} + \nabla_v R_{\beta  u}  - \nabla_u R_{\beta v} = 0$. Contracting the last two indices to get the Ricci scalar, meaning raise $\beta$ and contract with $v$ $\nabla_\alpha R^{\alpha\beta}_{ u \beta} + \nabla_\beta R^{\beta}_  u  - \nabla_u R^{\beta }_{\beta} = \nabla_\alpha R^\alpha_u + \nabla_\beta R^{\beta}_  u  - \partial_u R = 2\nabla_\beta R^{\beta}_  u - \partial_u R  = 0$. Then $\nabla_\beta R^{\beta}_  u  - \frac{1}{2} \partial_u R  = 0$. Raising the $u$ index, $g^{\eta u}(\nabla_\beta R^{\beta}_  u  - \frac{1}{2} \partial_u R) = \nabla_\beta R^{\beta  \eta} - \frac{1}{2} \nabla_u (g^{\eta u}R)= \nabla_u(R^{\eta u}-  \frac{1}{2} g^{\eta u}R) = 0 $. Defining $G^{uv} = R^{u v}-  \frac{1}{2} g^{u v}R$, the resulting equation is $\nabla_uG^{uv} = 0$. The $G$ is known as the Einstein tensor and appears in Einstein's field equations, which are the equations of motion in GR. In fact, the field equations are merely stating that the Einstein tensor is equal to the energy momentum tensor $T$, and if $T$ is conserved, then it can be set equal (or at least proportional) to $G$.</p>
