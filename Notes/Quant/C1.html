  <h2>Sample space and Sigma-Algebras</h2> Usually, probability is learned in two diff manners, meaning as a continuation of discrete probabilities and later as a measure define on the sigma algebra of a set. The latter is useful for especially uncountable spaces, and is completely rigorous.

Definition: Let $\Omega$ be a nonempty set and let $\mathcal F$ be a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ . $\mathcal F$ is a $\sigma-$algebra provided
$\emptyset \in \mathcal F$
if $A \in \mathcal F \Rightarrow A^c \in \mathcal F$
if $\{A\}_i \in \mathcal F\Rightarrow \cup{}\{A_n\}_{n=1}^\infty  \in \mathcal F$
If $A,B \in \mathcal F$, then the unions of the sets in a sigma algebra are also in the sigma algebra and the entire set $\Omega$ being the compliment of the empty set is in it too.
Also, note
$\emptyset\in \mathcal{F}\Rightarrow \emptyset^c=\Omega\in \mathcal{F}$. $\cap{}\{A_{i}\}_{i=1}^\infty =(\cup \{A_{i}^{c}\}_{n=1}^\infty )^c$ and since $A=\cup \{A_{i}^{c}\}_{n=1}^\infty \in \mathcal{F}$ and $A^c\in \mathcal{F}$, both by the definition of a $\sigma -$algebra, then ${}\cap \{A_{i}\}_{n=1}^\infty \in \mathcal{F}$. This means that countable intersections are also in a $\sigma -$algebra.

Note that $\mathcal{F{}}$ $\subset P(\Omega)$, meaning the powerset of $\Omega$. Therefore, $\Omega$ being of cardinality $|\Omega{}{}|{}{}$, implies that all possible subsets of $P(\Omega ){}$ has cardinality ${2^{|\Omega{}|{}}{}}^{|\Omega{}|{}}$ = $2^{|\Omega{}|{}{^2}}$.
 <h2>Probability Measure</h2>Definition: Let $\Omega$ be an nonempty and let $\mathcal F$ be a set of subsets of it which form a $\sigma -$algebra. A probability measure $P$ is a function $\forall A \in \mathcal F | P(A)\in\mathcal R, P:\mathcal{F{}}\rightarrow \mathcal{R}$.  It is require
$P(\Omega) = 1$
$\{A_ n {}{}\}_{n=1}^\infty  \in \mathcal F \Rightarrow P(\cup \{A_n\}_{n=1}^\infty )= \sum_{n=1{}}^\infty$$P(A_n)$ where, $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^\infty ,$ are mutually disjoint by definition.
This property is called, or defined, as countable additivity.
$(\Omega,\mathcal F, P)$ is called a probability space.

Note $P(\emptyset) = 0$ since $P(\emptyset ... \cup .... \emptyset)= P(\emptyset) = \sum_{n=1}^k P(\emptyset) = k P(\emptyset) \Rightarrow P(\emptyset) = 0$ is the only possibility for any integer $k \in \mathcal Z$ .
Finite additivity is implied from infinite (countable) additivity by merely taking the infinite collection of sets to be the empty set along with any number of finite sets.
Note that if $A \in \Omega \Rightarrow A \cup A^c = \Omega \Rightarrow P(A \cup A^c)= P(\Omega)=1 = P(A) + P(A^c \,)  \Rightarrow P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
Ex) Consider $\Omega = \mathcal{R }$. The $\sigma -$algebra in this situation $\mathcal F =\mathcal B$   is called the Borel $\sigma-$algebra. Closed intervals are a part of this $\sigma -$algebra.
The probability of closed intervals $[a,b]\subset \mathcal R{}$ is defined such that $P([x,y]) = \frac{x-y} {b - a }, a \leq x \leq y \leq 1$. This probability measure in the particular situation $[0,1]=\Omega{}$ is called the Lebesgue measure and is doted $\mathcal L$.
This measure denotes the length of an interval. Note that if $b=a$, the probability is zero, meaning that open intervals have the same probability as closed intervals: ${}\,P([a,b]) = P(\{a\}) + P(\{b\}) +P(a,b)={}P((a,b){})$ .


Ex) Consider the toss of a coin infinitely many times. Let $\Omega_\infty$ be the set of all possible outcomes. Assume the probability of $H$, a heads is $p$, and the probability of $T$, tails is $q = 1 - p$ , and the tosses are independent.
$\Omega _ {n \ }$ is the set of possible outcomes with $\sigma -$algebra$\ \mathcal F_n$.
Consider $0$ tosses, meaning $\Omega_0 = \emptyset$. $\mathcal F_0 =\{\emptyset,\Omega\}$. To construct a probability measure $P(\emptyset) = 0, P(\Omega) = 1$

Consider $1$ tosses, meaning $\Omega_1 = \{H,T\}$. $\mathcal F_0 =\{\emptyset,\Omega,H,T\}$. To construct a probability measure $P(\emptyset) = 0, P(\Omega) = 1$.

This can be continued $n\rightarrow \infty$ with $|\Omega_n | = 2 ^ n$, $|\mathcal F _ n {}|    = 2^{2 ^ n{}}$.

Consider subsets of $\Omega_\infty \,$by itself and note there can be a partition of this space of infinite coin tosses based on the outcomes of each individual flip. The elements of $\Omega_\infty$ can be indicated by the outcomes of the sequence of coin tosses $w=\sum_{i\in \mathcal Z[0,\infty {)} }w_i$.
$A_H$: the set of all sequences beginning with ${} A_H= \{\omega: \omega_1 = H\}$.
$A_T$: the set of all sequences beginning with ${} A_T= \{\omega: \omega_1 = H\}$.
These four sets do form a $\sigma-$algebra since $A_H^c = A_T$
$A_H\cup A_T=\Omega$. The associated $\sigma -$algebra defined $\mathcal F_1 = \{\emptyset,\Omega,A_H,A_T{}\}$.
The probability measure $P:\mathcal F _1\Rightarrow \mathcal R$ can be $P(A_ H )\ =p,P( A _ T \ )= q$.
For two tosses, $A_{HH} = \{\omega| \omega_1 = H, \omega_2 = H\}$, and similarly defined $A_{HT},A_{TH},A_{TT}$. The probability measure can be defined $P(A_{HH}) = p^2,P(A_{HT})=pq,P(A_{TH})=pq,P(A_{TT})=q^2$
These probabilities define implicitly the probabilities of their compliments, and all of their unions with each other.

Any finite number of tosses can be described probabilistically in this way and with the use of unions, even an infinite number of tosses can also be described. This probability for a single element in $\Omega_\infty \,$ $w_a =HHHHTHHHTHTTTHTHTH...HTHTHTHT...$ is just 0 since $P(w _ a ) = \prod_{i\in \mathcal Z[0,\infty {)} }w_i = ppppppqpqpqpppqpqp.....=0$ $\forall 0 < p,q \leq 1 {}$
The possibility that in any given sequence one $T$ occurs, $P(\{w:\exists\, T \in w\} \ )$ is the compliment of an infinite sequence of $H$, $P(\{w:\exists\, T \in w\} \ )= 1-P(\{HHHHHHH...\}{}) = 1 - 0 = 1$. Such an event is said to occur almost surely. Note therefore, there are events which occur with probability one, but there are possible outcomes where those events do not occur called null events $n \in \Omega_\infty$. However,
the set of all such events, $N$, has probability measure, $P( N {)}=\sum_{n\in N {} \ } P(\{n\} {}) = 0$.
This means that $\mathcal F_\infty$ can be defined as the sets generated by finitely many coin tosses and essentially' every other set that is required in order to have a $\sigma-$algebra', which is essentially $N$.

Note the cardinality$\,$of $\Omega_\infty \,$is just that of the real numbers, since it is just all possible countable infinite digit sequences.
Note however that $\mathcal F \neq P(\mathcal{R\ } )$, but $\mathcal{F } \subset P(\mathcal{R } {})$ meaning there are some subsets of $\mathcal{R{}}$ $\,x\in P(\mathcal{R}{})$, which are not measurable, in the sense of defining a probability measure to define probabilities. However,
the Borel sigma algebra, actually has cardinality which is the same as $\mathcal{R}$since it is the smallest possible sigma algebra which can be formed out of the real numbers. It can be created based on all closed intervals of the form $[a,b],a,b\in \mathcal{Q\ }$. Open intervals are defined in terms of closed intervals$(a,b)=\cup\{[a +\frac{1 }{ n },b-\frac{1}{n}]\}_{n=1}^\infty$. All complements and unions can be added into this sigma algebra, meaning that it can be defined to be a sigma algebra, but it would be formed out of all possible sequences of pairs of rational numbers, which has the cardinality of the real numbers .

Consider the set $A_{n,m}=\{\omega | \,|\frac{H_n(\omega_1...\omega_n)}{n}-\frac{1}{2} |\,\leq \frac{1}{m}\}$
For any given $n$: $H(\omega_1...\omega_n)$ is the number of $H$ in the first $n$ tosses, and has a probability which is defined in $\mathcal F_{n}$.
$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty } \frac{H_n(\omega_1...\omega_n)}{n} = \frac{1}{2{}}$ if $\exists N\forall n\geq N |A_{n,m{}}$ is true $\forall m\geq 0$. This means that $A = \cap_m\cup_N\cap_{n=N{{}}}^\infty A_{n,m}$ is the set of all $w$ which satisfies the above limit, and $A\in \mathcal F$ since it is defined in terms of unions and intersections of sets which are in $\mathcal F$.

<h2>Random Variables</h2> Definition: A random variable $X$ is a real valued function, defined such that $X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal R,$ meaning it maps elements of $\Omega$ to elements of $\mathcal{R{}}$
Note a random variable induces a probability measure, called the distribution measure $\mu _X:\mathcal{B{}}\rightarrow \mathcal R$
Note this is a measure on $(\mathcal{R}{},\mathcal{B\  )}$ and it uses $P$ defined on $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}{})$.
$\ B\in \mathcal B | \{X \in B\} = \{\omega\in\Omega | X(\omega) \in B\}$, $\mu _X(B)=P(\{X\in B\})$. Note this is valid $\{X\in B\}\in \mathcal{B{}}$
The possible values of a random variable are merely all the Borel subsets which allow for that value of the random variable to be.

Random variables have distributions, but random variables can have the same distribution, while a single random variable can have two different distributions.

Ex) Define stock prices by the formula $S(n + 1 ) = \begin{cases}2{}S(n )\,w_n = H \\\frac{S(n)}{2}\, w_n= T{} \end{cases}$.
This is a random variable



Ex) Let $P\,$ be the uniform measure on $[\,0,1]$, the Lebesgue measure. Define two random variables $X(\omega) = \omega, Y(\omega) = 1 - \omega\ \forall \omega \in [0,1]$. Then, the distribution measure of $X , \mu _X([a,b]) = P(\{w\in \Omega:w \in [a,b {}]{}\})= b-a$ .$\mu_Y([a,b]) = P(\{ w{}|Y(w{}{}) \in [a,b]\})$$=P(\{ w{}|1-ws \in [a,b]\})= P(\{\omega: a \leq 1 - \omega \leq b \} ) =  P(\{\omega| -1(-1+a) \geq -1(-\omega{} \geq-1(-1 + b{})\}{})$$= P([1-b,1-a] {}) = (1-a) - (1-b) = b - a = \mu_X[a,b]$.
Now consider if another probability measure $\tilde P$ is defined on $[0,1]$ as $\tilde P[a,b] =\int_a^b 2\omega d\omega = b^2 - a^2 , 0 \leq a \leq b \leq 1$ . In this situation $\tilde\mu_X[a,b]$ $=\tilde P \{\omega| a \leq X(\omega)\leq b\}=\tilde P [a,b] = b^2 - a^2, 0 \leq a \leq b \leq 1$ . Also,$\tilde\mu_Y[a.b] = (1-a)^2 - (1-b)^2$

It is also possible that for every probability measure, there can also be an associated CDF $F(x)=P(\{y:y\leq x\} {})$. Note this is the probability assigned to the Borel subset $(-\infty ,x]\in \mathcal B {} \subset\,{}2^\Omega$ with$\,\Omega=\mathcal R$,  $F(x )={}P(\{y:y\in  {}({}-\infty ,x ]\} )$ If $F(x{})$ is the derivative of some function, $f(x )\Rightarrow  F(x{}) = \int_{-\infty} ^xf(u )d {}u$. This gives the interpretation$\,dF(u) = f(u )du$. Then, $dF=dP(\{y:y\in dx\}{}\,)$. $f$ is called the pdf.

ex) Consider the random variable $Y$ defined on $\Omega_\infty ,$ $Y_n(w{}) = \begin{cases}1 \, w_n = H \\ 0 \, w _ n = T\end{cases}$ . Note this can be viewed as a sequence of random variables for each $n$, or it's a set of infinite sequence of possible outcomes of each of these variables, defined with respect to the entire space.
Define new random variable $X = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{Y_n}{2^n}$. This exists only on the entire space, as it's not defined for each $n$, but rather with respect to an infinite sequence of tosses.
Note that for any interval $[\frac{k {}}{  2^n},\frac{k+1}{2^n}]  \subset [0,1$], $k\in \mathcal Z[0,\infty )\,{}$$P([\frac{k {}}{  2^n},\frac{k+1}{2^n}] ){}= \mathcal L{}([\frac{k {}}{  2^n},\frac{k+1}{2^n}]   ){ =\frac{k+1}{2^n} {}-\frac{k {}}{  2^n}}{} = \frac{ {}1 {}}{  2^n}$.
$\mu_X  [\frac{k}{2^n},\frac{m}{2^n}] = P(\{w:X(w )\in [\frac{k}{2^n},\frac{m}{2^n}]\}{})\,$= $\frac{1}{2^n}(m-k)$ with $k < m$.

Ex) $\phi(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}{}}e^{-x^2/2}$ be the standard normal density, the standard normal pdf. The CDF associated with this PDF $N(x)=\int_{-\infty{}{}}^x\phi(x')dx'$ . Note that it is strictly increasing, mapping $\mathcal R$ to $(0,1)$, and so has a strictly increasing inverse function $N^{-1{}{}}(y) = y$. Now let $Y{}$ be defined on the probability space such that $X = N^{-1}(Y)$. Then the measure is $\mu_X([a,b]{}) = \int_a^b \phi(x)dx$ . This can be done for any uniform distribution, and is called the probability integral transform. (Seems to be just a change of variables)
