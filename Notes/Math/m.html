  <h4 style="margin-top: 0">These will be notes taken from Tao, Analysis 1 and 11. This is the best, most intuitive book on real analysis that I could find, which teaches it as a physicist, or quant, would approach.
  The reason I am studying it explicitly is that I feel that I need to be comfortable with the language in which theories and models of physics and quantitative finance are written in to really be able to understand it. Also, I like it.</h4>
