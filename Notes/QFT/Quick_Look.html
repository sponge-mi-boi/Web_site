<h1 id="Quick-Look-at-the-Anti-Unitary-Nature-of-the-Time-Reversal-Operator">Quick Look at the Anti-Unitary Nature of the Time Reversal Operator</h1><p>Let us take a quick look at the Schrodinger equation: i $\frac{d}{dt}$
|t &gt;= H|t &gt;. Rewriting it $\frac{d}{dt}$ |t &gt;= −iH|t &gt;. Solving, |t &gt;= $e^{−iHt}$|0 &gt; where |0 &gt; describes the
state of the system at t = 0. Essentially, then, the equation just describes the
fact that a system evolves according to its Hamiltonian as time is treated as
an independent variable. This is not much actually different from any generic
classical description of the system, but rather the mathematical language used
to describe the system as changed from just classical equations to operators and
states. This is actually why canonical quantization, the replacement of classical
Poisson brackets with commutators, and the replacement of observable quantities with their corresponding operators, ”works” despite not necessarily being
mathematically rigorous. One is just describing the system in a different way
and, at the right unit scales, the quantum system behaves almost exactly classically. In fact, this is why it makes sense to take the solution to the Schrodinger
equation as the quantum action and minimize it to obtain the resulting equations of motion for the system. This is what QFT is all about and perturbation
theory is used since most systems do not have an exact solution. Then, any system can be described in a multitude of bases, the two main ones being the
position basis |x &gt; and the momentum basis |k &gt;. A representation of a system
in a given basis means that all the operators in the system and the state of
the system are written in terms of this new basis.This is done easily using the
corresponding completeness relations, $\int dx$|x &gt;&lt; x|, and $\int dk$|k &gt;&lt; k|, where x
and k can both of course range from -infinity to infinity. Then, |t &gt; which is the
fundamental basis in the sense that a system is defined of course to evolve in
time can be described in terms of either one. For example, &lt; x|ϕ|t &gt;= ϕ(x, t),
which is essentially how much of the given x is on the given t, meaning where
exactly is the particle at that given time. This is given the interpretation of a
wavefunction which is used to describe the position of the
R particle in spacetime.
Now, x and k have a relationship defined by |x &gt;= $\int dk$|k &gt;&lt; k|x &gt;. Since
when one usually describes functions in space in terms of functions in momenta,
one uses Fourier transforms one takes by definition &lt; k|x &gt;= $e^{ikx}$ . This is
made even more clear when one looks at the orthogonality
relations for x and
k, where specifically &lt; x′ |x &gt;= δ(x′ − x) →&lt; x′ ( $\int dk$|k &gt;&lt; k|)x &gt;= $\int dk$ &lt;x′ |k &gt;&lt; k|x &gt;= δ(x′ − x) → $\int dk$2π$e^{ik(x−x' )}$ . By redefining to put the 2π in
the denominator in whatever way one prefers just as for regular Fourier transforms, one can obtain the above relationship. Then, looking at the definition
of the time reversal operator, one can see why it must be anti-unitary. We
want an operator such that T |t &gt;= −|t &gt;, but it must also commute with the
Hamiltonian so that we can observe the effect of time reversal or at least give it
some measurable meaning, $[H, T ] = 0$. Then, applying to the Schrodinger equation ,one gets T (−i($\frac{d}{dt}$)|t &gt;= T (H|t &gt;) → −iT ($\frac{d}{dt}$)|t &gt;= H(T |t &gt;). Now,
T ($\frac{d}{dt}$) = −$\frac{d}{dt}$T since it would be applied only on eigenstates of time, which
do not depend on time explicitly, since all of them are orthogonal. Then, if we
want T|t &gt; to satisfy the Schrodinger equation as well and to be a solution, and
furthermore to have the equations of motion be invariant under time reversal,
one gets −i($\frac{d}{dt}$)T |t &gt;= −HT |t &gt; which is not valid so then we must define
−iT = T i, which then leads to the right equation of motion.</p>
